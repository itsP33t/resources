## Adding new site
Go to[ `src/data`](https://github.com/itsP33t/resources/tree/main/src/data " `src/data`") and choose a topic. Open the .ts file and follow the structure. Then just open a pull request

If you want to create a new topic, create a new issue and i will create it. Alternatively you can use the `__template__.ts` inside [ `src/data`](https://github.com/itsP33t/resources/tree/main/src/data " `src/data`") and see how previous topics were made
